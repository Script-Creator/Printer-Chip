# Printer Chip
A little cheeky way to give people access to my E2s without them having to ask us for files all the time. I'll update this area to look more impressive in the near future.

## Function
This is an E2 that will automatically find and control a user to fire on any model that matches the printer model. It will automatically find EGP HUDs or Screens nearby (depending on your preference) and give a UI that gives direct knowledge about a few things:
- Initial Money
- Profit (Raw Value, Per hour/minute/second)
- Lowest Battery
- Lowest Coolant
- Time Elapsed

## Roadmap
- Automatically Find User [] < Easy
- Move the User to Printers [] < Easy
- Fire the User over every printer [] < Easy
- Ensure the User won't freeze (due to leaving/breaking printers) [] < Medium but Time Consuming
- Automatically Find UI [] < Easy
- Create the UI [] < Easy but Time Consuming
